SmartTracker Project Report
1. Introduction
SmartTracker is a cross-platform mobile application developed using Flutter. The app integrates mobile
device sensors such as GPS and Camera, interacts with a REST API for real-time data
synchronization, and stores recent activities offline for quick access.
2. Objectives
- Utilize GPS to capture and display live user location.
- Integrate device Camera for capturing activity images.
- Sync activity logs (location, timestamp, image) with a remote REST API.
- Provide CRUD functionality for viewing, searching, and deleting logs.
- Store recent 5 activities offline using local storage.
- Follow clean architecture principles.
- Ensure responsiveness across devices.
3. API Design
Base URL:
Endpoints:
GET /activities – Fetch all logs
GET /activities/:id – Fetch a log
POST /activities – Add activity
DELETE /activities/:id – Delete activity
4. App Architecture
- UI Layer
- State Management (Provider)
- Repository Layer
- Data Layer
5. Sensor Handling
GPS using geolocator.
Camera using camera package.
6. Offline Storage
Using Hive or SharedPreferences to store 5 recent activities.
7. Testing Scenarios
- API testing via Postman
- Sensor testing (GPS, Camera)
- Offline mode testing
8. Conclusion
SmartTracker fulfills all requirements of the Complex Computing Problem, integrating sensors, API, and
offline capabilities.
